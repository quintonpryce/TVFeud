Apple TV Feud!

After buying an Apple TV I noticed there aren't a whole lot of party games on it. With it being such a great platform I made a Family Feud knock off for it (don't tell them ðŸ˜„)!

Feel free to download and throw on your Apple TV to enjoy some fun with friends! 

I got the questions from this this [reddit article](https://www.reddit.com/r/trivia/comments/3wzpvt/free_database_of_50000_trivia_questions/).
